description: A comprehensive list of all the commands I always forget.

So I don't know about you, but I sometimes have a hard time remembering exactly what git commands do what.

It's because of this, I've decided to have this post as a way to add those which I tend to use most often. So let's get to it!

```
git pull origin [branch]
git branch -d [branch]

```

More coming soon...
